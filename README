This was a programming exercise. Requirements were:

- Use your language of choice.
- Write tests.
- Focus on simplicity.
- Please leave you code in a runnable state so we can go over your code and
  example outputs together during your on-site.
- Work incrementally. Don’t read ahead too far, trick is to complete one task,
  then move on.
- You can assume correct inputs. Don’t worry about a tonne of edge cases.

I'd argue that the Java version is simple, in that functionality is isolated in
a way that makes it easier to modify without affecting tests for unmodified
code. It wasn't simple to write, but being lazy at the start costs more later.
